1. Is the service RESTful? If not, why not? If so, what key features make it RESTful.
    It is RESTful. It follows the http protocol (maps to CRUD correctly). Another feature is that it is stateless. 
2. What endpoints implement actions that are idempotent? nullipotent?
    Get, post, and delete are idempotent because we can call them as many times as desired, and the result will not change depending on you calling it 1 time or 50 times. Post is nullpotent, if it is called more than once on the object, there will be two identical copies of the object
